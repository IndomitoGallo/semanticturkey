# Semantic Turkey #
## A Firefox Semantic Bookmarking and Annotation Extension ##

_This is the LEGACY site hosting development of Semantic Turkey. To view our current ST development, please reach the new site hosted on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/art-uniroma2/semantic-turkey/)_

Semantic Turkey is a platform for Semantic Bookmarking and Ontology Development realized by the [ART Research Group](http://art.uniroma2.it) at the [University of Rome, Tor Vergata](http://www.uniroma2.it)

By adopting W3C standards for knowledge representation, such as [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/), [RDFS](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/), [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) (and partial support for [SKOSXL](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-xl.html)) Semantic Turkey turns the popular Web Browser Firefox into a rich and extensible framework for knowledge acquisition, management and exchange. Users can adopt Semantic Turkey to keep track of relevant information from visited web sites and organize collected content according to imported/personally edited ontologies. Domain experts and ontology developers can now build ontologies starting from the very raw source of information which they find on the web, without any need of interconnecting different heterogeneous tools and applications

Semantic Turkey is built on top of several different technologies such as Java and Javascript, [XUL](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/), [XBL](http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl/), and features a three layered (data, business and interaction models) architecture, exploiting the AJAX paradigm for UI/Business logic communication. By exploiting acclaimed modularization frameworks such as OSGi compliant Apache Felix and the Mozilla extension environment, Semantic Turkey can be easily [extended](http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/?frame=Documentation&page=html/documentation/developers.xhtml) with new plug'n'play applications, embracing the best of both worlds of Knowledge Engineering and Web Browsing. Depending on their needs, extension developers can thus rely on different RDF management libraries, such as [Sesame](http://www.openrdf.org/) or [Jena](http://www.openrdf.org/), as well as reuse and integrate functionalities from the full range of extensions in the [Firefox Add-ons repository](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/)

## The three Web Sites ##

This is the project site of Semantic Turkey, containing source code, bug reports etc...
If you have stumbled upon this site for the first time, we recommend first to visit [Semantic Turkey main site](http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it), which contains useful information such as installation requirements, documentation etc...
...and if you don't like manuals, please give at least a look to the [requirements](http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/documentation/#requirements) section of the main site, to know what you need for running Semantic Turkey! :-)

To install Semantic Turkey, visit the [Semantic Turkey Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8880) page to download its xpi (Cross-Platform Installer) package (again, read the [requirements](http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/documentation/#requirements) section before downloading it).
